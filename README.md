# Cryptocurrencies

## Analysis Overview

- Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- visualizing classification results with 2D and 3D scatter plots.

### Purpose 
Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked you to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

## Resources
**Data Source:** [crypto_data.csv](https://github.com/CGFS93/Cryptocurrencies/blob/main/Resources/crypto_data.csv).

**Software:** Python, Conda, Jupyter Notebook.


## Results


### Clustering Cryptocurrencies using K-Means - Elbow Curve
The output of this analysis is unknown so unsupervised machine learning is utilized to identify clusters for cryptocurrencies.\
The K-Means method iterating on k values from 1 to 10. 

The best k value appears to be 4 so in conclusion to use an output of 4 clusters to categorize the crytocurrencies.
<br><br>

### Visualizing Cryptocurrencies
#### 3D-Scatter plot with clusters

The 3-D scatter plot was obtained using the PCA algorithm to reduce the crytocurrencies dimensions to three principal components.
<br><br>

#### 2D-Scatter plot with clusters

The 2-D scatter plot was obtained using the PCA algorithm to reduce the crytocurrencies dimensions to two principal components.
<br><br>
Both scatter plots show the distribution and the four clusters of cryptocurrencies.<br>
The outliers identify the unique cryptocurrency in the class #2.
<br><br>

#### Tradable Cryptocurrencies Table

Most of the cryptocurrencies are part of class #0 and #1.<br>
BitTorrent is the only cryptocurrency in class #2.
<br><br>

#### 2D-Scatter plot with TotalCoinMined vs TotalCoinSupply

Plotting the scatter plot from two cryptocurrency features are not efficiently segregated by different classes. Using the PCA algorithm is the right method for better visualizations.
<br><br>

## Summary
The identified classification of 532 cryptocurrencies are based on similarities among features.\
Particularities of each group need to be analyzed to determined their performance and potential interest for the investment bank's clients.
